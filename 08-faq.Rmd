## Error unable to load package after installation.

This error is generally related to the ComplexHeatmap dependency, used by heatmap functions in CopyKit and it has been reported in MacOS devices. The following are instructions to install Cairo.

You might need to install the following:

```
Xquartz - https://www.xquartz.org/

In R: install.packages("Cairo", dependencies=TRUE)
```

## CopyKit is very slow despite parallel processing

This issue has been generally associated with running and registering CopyKit parallel functions within Rmarkdown files (.Rmd) or R notebook files. We recommend running CopyKit functions within R scripts (.R)
