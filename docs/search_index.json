For that, CopyKit presents four modules: - Pre-processing - Quality Control - Data Analysis - Visualization The following chapters will cover each module in detail. copykit cheat sheet Generated with CopyKit version: packageVersion(&quot;copykit&quot;) ## [1] &#39;0.1.2&#39; "],["parallelization.html", "2 Parallelization", " 2 Parallelization Whenever possible, CopyKit uses the BiocParallel framework. Running parallel processes is highly recommended to speed up CopyKit calculations. Make sure to read the BiocParallel vignette to choose the best parameters for your machine and OS. Use BiocParallel::register() function to register the number of workers (threads) desired. To visually monitor the progress, you can use the argument progressbar. library(BiocParallel) register(MulticoreParam(progressbar = T, workers = 8), default = T) Confirm parameters: BiocParallel::bpparam() Note about plotHeatmap() function parallelization: plotHeatmap() uses a different framework and requires the argument n_threads to set the number of threads when in use with the argument order_cells = hclust. This is to speed up the calculation of a distance matrix. Using more threads when ordering the heatmap with hclust will significantly speed up the plotting of the heatmap. See example in plotHeatmap help.

For more information check the parallelization section. 4.1 From Single Cell BAM files 4.1.1 runVarbin() The runVarbin() function takes in the file path of the folder where your marked duplicate BAM files are located. Each cell must be its own BAM file. For Chromium single cell CNA users (10X Genomics), this means splitting the possorted.bam file by cell barcode into individual BAM files. If files are originated from paired-end sequencing, please ensure that the argument “is_paired_end” is set to TRUE during `runVarbin(). Once run, runVarbin() uses the variable binning method to count the number of reads in each genomic bin. - Learn More!. A snakemake pipeline is provided here to convert FASTQ files to marked BAM files, but it is not a required step. If you already have marked BAM files from another source, you can skip this step. Note that the reads must be aligned to the same genome assembly as used in CopyKit. The input for runVarbin() is the path of the folder containing your marked duplicate .bam files. An optional second argument remove_Y provides a convenient shortcut to exclude chromosome Y from the dataset. To learn about all arguments that runVarbin() accepts use ?runVarbin tumor &lt;- runVarbin(&quot;~/path/to/bam/files/&quot;, remove_Y = TRUE) ## Counting reads for genome hg38 and resolution: 220kb ## 34 bam files had less than 10 mean bincounts and were removed. ## Performing GC correction. ## Running variance stabilization transformation: ft ## Smoothing outlier bins. ## Running segmentation algorithm: CBS for genome hg38 ## Merging levels. ## Done. The runVarbin() function uses the hg38 genome assembly and a 220kb bin resolution by default, but these can be adjusted using the \"genome\" or \"resolution\" arguments. If your BAM files come from paired-end sequencing, be sure to set the \"is_paired_end\" argument to TRUE. (See the function documentation for more information: ?runVarbin) tumor &lt;- runVarbin(&quot;~/path/to/bam/files/&quot;, remove_Y = TRUE, is_paired_end = TRUE) The resulting object is the CopyKit object. tumor ## class: CopyKit ## dim: 11268 1502 ## metadata(3): genome resolution vst ## assays(6): bincounts ft ... ratios logr ## rownames(11268): 1 2 ... 11267 11268 ## rowData names(3): gc_content abspos arm ## colnames(1502): PMTC6LiverC100DL1S2_S100_L001_R1_001 ## PMTC6LiverC100DL1S6_S484_L002_R1_001 ... ## PMTC6LiverC9DL1S5_S393_L002_R1_001 PMTC6LiverC9DL6L7S1_S1161_L004_R1_001 ## colData names(9): sample reads_assigned_bins ... reads_total ## percentage_duplicates ## reducedDimNames(0): ## mainExpName: NULL ## altExpNames(0): ## rowRanges has: 11268 ranges ## Phylo: Phylogenetic tree with 0 tips and nodes ## consensus dim: 0 0 CopyKit objects inherit from the SingleCellExperiment class.

The runVarbin() function allows for the selection of different segmentation methods using the method argument, which can be set to either CBS or multipcf. By default, the function uses the Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) - Learn More! - method from the DNAcopy package. An additional argument, alpha, controls the significance levels required to accept change-points. The second segmentation option is the Multi-sample Piecewise Constant Fit (multipcf) segmentation from the copynumber package, which performs a joint segmentation of the samples and identifies common breakpoints across all samples. The resulting segmentation is stored within the CopyKit object into two different assays: ratios and segment_ratios.

It is important to note that if you have already started from runVarbin(), you do not need to run these functions again. The details of these functions is to enable you to run the modules under different conditions without requiring you to re-run all runVarbin() module. 4.2.0.1 runCountReads() The runCountReads() function counts the reads into bins, and performs GC correction of the counts - Learn More!. The genome argument defines the genome assembly (“hg38”, “hg19”) and the resolution argument specifies the size of the variable bins (“55kb”, “110kb”, “195kb”, “220kb”, “280kb”, “500kb”, “1Mb”, “2.8Mb”). The remove_Y argument provides a convenient shortcut to exclude the chromosome Y from the dataset. 4.2.0.2 runVst() The runVst() function performs variance stabilization transformation on the bin counts, using either the freeman-tukey (‘ft’) or ‘log’ transformation. 4.2.0.3 runSegmentation() The runSegmentation() function runs either the ‘CBS’ or ‘multipcf’ segmentation, and then merges consecutive segments that don’t reach the significance threshold Learn More!. The argument alpha controls the significance threshold for CBS segmentation, whil th gamma argument controls the penalty for the multipcf segmentation. 4.2.0.4 logNorm() logNorm() performs a log transformation of the segment_ratios assay and stores into the logr assay. The logr assay is used downstream by functions such as runUmap(). 4.3 From external count data or user-defined scaffolds To use CopyKit’s downstream functions with processed datasets, we can create a CopyKit object meeting the following requirements: Either a bin count matrix where columns represent cells and rows represent bins (to be stored in the bincounts assay) or a segment mean ratios matrix where columns represent cells and rows represent segment mean values for each bin. An integer matrix of copy number calls can also be used at this step (to be stored in the segment_ratios assay). A GenomicRanges object with length equal to the number of bins from the cell assay matrix. As long as the length requirement is respected this allows user-defined scaffolds to be used within CopyKit. To construct the CopyKit object, the following mock code is presented as an example. If providing bincounts: obj &lt;- CopyKit(list(bincounts = cell_bincount_matrix), rowRanges = genomic_ranges_scaffold) If providing bincounts, the functions runVst(), runSegmentation(), and logNorm() can be used to continue with the analysis. To obtain variance stabilized counts, and segment ratio means. If providing segment mean ratios: obj &lt;- CopyKit(list(segment_ratios = cell_bincount_matrix), rowRanges = genomic_ranges_scaffold) It is useful to call logNorm() and set the logr slot for downstream functions. The resulting object can then be passed on to the Quality Control and Analysis modules of CopyKit. Furthermore, it is useful for downstream functions to add the genome assembly used on the dataset. metadata(obj)$genome &lt;- &quot;hg38&quot; NOTE: If no bincount matrix is provided, functions that require a matrix of bincounts, such as runMetrics() can’t be used with this object.

To detect euploid cells findAneuploidCells() calculates the sample-wise coefficient of variation from the segment ratio means. The expected coefficient of variation for euploid cells N(0, 0.01) is simulated for x data points, where x is equal to the number of cells within the dataset. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used to fit a mixture of gaussian distributions to the coefficient of variation from the samples together with the simulated datasets. The distribution containing the simulated dataset is inferred to be the euploid distribution. Samples that group with the inferred euploid distribution and present coefficient of variation smaller than 5 standard deviations from the mean euploid distribution are classified as euploid samples. The threshold can be changed from the automatic detection to a custom threshold with the argument resolution. For example, by setting a threshold = 0.1, findAneuploidCells will mark as euploid all cells with a coefficient of variation less or equal than 0.1. tumor &lt;- findAneuploidCells(tumor) ## number of iterations= 23 ## Copykit detected 610 that are possibly diploid cells using a resolution of: 0.074 ## Added information to colData(CopyKit).

The object is subsetted in the same way as with any R object, to keep only the aneuploid cells. tumor &lt;- tumor[,colData(tumor)$is_aneuploid == TRUE] 5.3 findOutliers() findOutliers() annotates low-quality cells according to a defined resolution threshold. To detect low-quality samples, CopyKit calculates the Pearson correlation matrix of all samples from the segment ratio means. Next, we calculate a sample-wise mean of the correlation between a cell and its k-nearest-neighbors (default = 5). Cells in which the correlation value is lower than the defined threshold are classified as low-quality cells (default = 0.9). tumor &lt;- findOutliers(tumor) ## Calculating correlation matrix. ## Marked 99 cells as outliers. ## Adding information to metadata. Access with colData(scCNA). ## Done. The default correlation cutoff for filtering can be adjusted with the argument ‘resolution’. For example, setting the resolution = 0.8 will mark all cells with a mean correlation smaller than 0.8 as low-quality cells. Higher resolution values will result in stricter filtering criterias. Results from findOutliers() are added to colData (column outlier) marking cells that can be removed or kept. We can check the results with plotHeatmap(). To make visualization easier, rows can also be split according to elements of colData with the argument row_split. plotHeatmap(tumor, label = &#39;outlier&#39;, row_split = &#39;outlier&#39;, n_threads = 40) ## order_cells argument is NULL.

"],["knn-smoothing.html", "6 kNN smoothing", " 6 kNN smoothing scDNA-Seq experiments are often sparsely sequenced and present inherent noise from low-coverage datasets. To mitigate this, CopyKit is capable of smoothing profiles based on the k-nearest neighbors of each single cell. This way, CopyKit aggregates the genomic bin counts based on a cell k-nearest neighbors, followed by re-segmentation of copy number profiles. In order to ensure optimal performane it is essential to carefully consider the number of neighbors (k) used in the smoothing process. We recommend to use conservative k values, which are below the number of cells that compose the smallest subclone, and to visually inspect and compare smoothed single cells to the original profiles tumor &lt;- knnSmooth(tumor) ## Finding neighbors. ## Smoothing cells using k = 4 ## Running variance stabilization transformation: ft ## Smoothing outlier bins. ## Running segmentation algorithm: CBS for genome hg38 ## Merging levels. ## Done. ## Replacing segment_ratios assay. ## Replacing logr assay. ## Done. This step is recommended after the filtering process. Though we have noticed that smoothing can also rescue cells with low-depth quality. If done so, additional inspection is recommended due to the possibility of increased noise.

If a label argument is supplied, the points will be colored based on that information. plotMetrics(tumor, metric = c(&quot;overdispersion&quot;, &quot;breakpoint_count&quot;, &quot;reads_total&quot;, &quot;reads_duplicates&quot;, &quot;reads_assigned_bins&quot;, &quot;percentage_duplicates&quot;), label = &quot;percentage_duplicates&quot;) ## Coloring by: percentage_duplicates 7.2 plotRatio() Visualizing the seegmeentation to eensure it follows the ratios as expected is crucial to a copy number analysis. This helps to verify the accuracy of the segmentation an assess the quality of the data visually. The plotRatio() function is a useful tool for this, offering two different modes. When the input is the CopyKit object, an interactive app will open, allowing you to choose which cell to visualize from the drop-down option menu. plotRatio(tumor) Ratio Plot App Providing a sample name to the plotRatio() function with the argument sample_name, will display the plot only for the selected cell. plotRatio(tumor, &quot;PMTC6LiverC117AL4L5S1_S885_L003_R1_001&quot;) 7.3 runUmap() The runUmap() function generates a UMAP embedding, which is stored in the reducedDim slot. runUmap() is an important pre-processing step for the findClusters() feature. tumor &lt;- runUmap(tumor) ## Using assay: logr ## Embedding data with UMAP. Using seed 17 ## Access reduced dimensions slot with: reducedDim(scCNA, &#39;umap&#39;). ## Done. You can pass additional arguments to control UMAP parameters using the '...' argument. The full list of additional arguments that can be passed on to uwot::umap with the ‘…’ argument can be found in the uwot manual and information on their influence on clustering can be seen in the UMAP webpage 7.4 Clustering The findClusters() function performs clustering using the UMAP embedding generated by runUmap(). For detecting subclones, CopyKit uses different clustering algorithms such as: hdbscan (recommended) Leiden Louvain The hdbscan method is recommended and has been previously successfully applied in the work from Laks et al. and Minussi et al.. 7.4.1 findSugestedK() The findSuggestedK() is a helper function that provides guidance to choose the k parameter for clustering algorithms. The function findSuggestedK bootstraps clustering over a range of k values, and returns the value that maximizes the jaccard similarity, with median as the default metric (argument metric). While findSuggestedK does not guarantee optimal clustering. It provides a guide to select k values. tumor &lt;- findSuggestedK(tumor) ## Calculating jaccard similarity for k range: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ## ## Suggested k = 23 with median jaccard similarity of: 1 The plotSuggestedK() function can be used to inspect the results of findSuggestedK(). It can plot a boxplot, heatmap (tile), or scatterplot plotSuggestedK(tumor) If the argument geom is set to tile, plotSuggestedK() plots a heatmap where each row is a detected subclone, each column is a k assessed during the grid search and the color represents the jaccard similarity for a given clone. The suggested value can be accessed from the metadata: S4Vectors::metadata(tumor)$suggestedK ## [1] 23 7.4.2 findClusters() To run findClusters(), pass the CopyKit object as its input. If findSuggestedK() was run beforehand, findClusters() will automatically use the stored value from findSuggestedK() as the argument for k_subclones, unless otherwise specified. tumor &lt;- findClusters(tumor) ## Using suggested k_subclones = 23 ## Finding clusters, using method: hdbscan ## Found 4 subclones. ## Done. If hdbscan is used for clustering, singleetons outliers may bee idenetifieed and added to subgroup c0. Copykit will notify you of any cells classified as c0 after running findClusters(). To remove outliers, subset the CopyKit object with: tumor &lt;- tumor[,colData(tumor)$subclones != &#39;c0&#39;] 7.4.3 plotUmap() plotUmap() can be used to visualize the reduced dimensional embedding. plotUmap can be colored by any element of the colData with the argument ‘label’. plotUmap(tumor) ## Plotting Umap. Cells can be colored with the argument ‘label’ by any element of colData(): plotUmap(tumor, label = &#39;subclones&#39;) ## Plotting Umap. ## Coloring by: subclones. 7.5 runPhylo() To run a phylogenetic analysis of cells’ copy number profiles, use the function runPhylo(). Available methods are Neighbor Joining and Balanced Minimum evolution. The resulting tree is stored within the CopyKit object in the phylo slot: tumor &lt;- runPhylo(tumor, metric = &#39;manhattan&#39;) ## Using ratio data... ## Calculating distance matrix ## Creating neighbor-joining tree. ## Access slot with copykit::phylo(scCNA). ## Done. 7.5.1 plotPhylo() To visualize the resulting phylogenetic trees from runPhylo() we can use the plotPhylo() function. plotPhylo(tumor) ## Warning: The tree contained negative edge lengths. If you want to ignore the edges, you ## can set &#39;options(ignore.negative.edge=TRUE)&#39;, then re-run ggtree. plotPhylo() can use any element of the colData to color the leaves of the tree. plotPhylo(tumor, label = &#39;subclones&#39;) ## Warning: The tree contained negative edge lengths. If you want to ignore the edges, you ## can set &#39;options(ignore.negative.edge=TRUE)&#39;, then re-run ggtree. 7.6 calcInteger() The true underlying copy number states for a given region of the genome are given in integer states. We can use the segment ratio means to make an inference of the copy number state for a given genomic region. Keep in mind that those are inferences and, as such, are subjected to errors of different sources, like erroneous inference or rounding errors. Segment ratio means can be scaled to integer values with calcInteger(). CopyKit supports different methods of calculating integer copy number profiles. To calculate computational ploidies, a method is in development and should be available soon within copykit. By setting the argument method to fixed, a fixed value of ploidy (generally determined using Flow Cytometry) will scale all cells. tumor &lt;- calcInteger(tumor, method = &#39;fixed&#39;, ploidy_value = 4.3) ## Scaling ratio values by ploidy value 4.3 The integer values are stored in the slot integer that can be accessed with the function assay(). If the assay integer exists, plotRatio() will use it to plot the integer copy number values as a secondary axis. plotRatio(tumor, &quot;PMTC6LiverC117AL4L5S1_S885_L003_R1_001&quot;) 7.7 plotHeatmap() To visualize copy number profiles with a heatmap we can use plotHeatmap(). The heatmap can be annotated with elements of colData. To order subclones, one option is to calculate a consensus phylogeny, explained in later sections: tumor &lt;- calcConsensus(tumor) tumor &lt;- runConsensusPhylo(tumor) To plot the heatmap. plotHeatmap(tumor, label = &#39;subclones&#39;, order_cells = &#39;consensus_tree&#39;) ## Ordering cells by:consensus_tree ## Plotting Heatmap. Genes can be annotated to a heatmap in plotHeatmap() with the genes argument. The genes argument is a vector of gene HUGO symbols: plotHeatmap(tumor, label = &#39;subclones&#39;, genes = c(&quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;BRAF&quot;, &quot;MYC&quot;), order_cells = &#39;consensus_tree&#39;) ## Ordering cells by:consensus_tree ## Plotting Heatmap. To plot integer copy number heatmaps pass the argument assay = 'integer', importantly the integer matrix must be in the 'integer'slot. plotHeatmap(tumor, assay = &#39;integer&#39;, order_cells = &#39;consensus_tree&#39;) ## Ordering cells by:consensus_tree ## Plotting Heatmap. New information can be added to colData() and used in conjunction with the plotting functions. The example dataset has macro-spatial information. The information is encoded in the sample name by the letter L followed by a number. We can extract that information and add it as an extra column to the metadata: colData(tumor)$spatial_info &lt;- stringr::str_extract(colData(tumor)$sample, &quot;L[0-9]&quot;) Once the information has been added, we can use it to color the umap by their spatial information: plotUmap(tumor, label = &#39;spatial_info&#39;) ## Plotting Umap. ## Coloring by: spatial_info. It is also possible to annotate the heatmap with that information: The ‘label’ argument for plotHeatmap() can add as many annotations as specified by the user as long as they are elements in colData() of the CopyKit object. plotHeatmap(tumor, label = c(&quot;spatial_info&quot;, &quot;subclones&quot;), order_cells = &#39;consensus_tree&#39;) ## Ordering cells by:consensus_tree ## Plotting Heatmap. 7.8 plotFreq() Computing the frequencies of genomic gain or losses across the genome can be useful to visualize differences between groups. This can be done with plotFreq(). For every region of the genome, plotFreq() will calculate the frequency of gain or losses according to a threshold across all samples. The thresholds are controlled with the arguments low_threshold (values below will be counted as genomic losses) and high_threshold (values above will be counted as genomic gains). Ideally thresholds will be set according to the ploidy of the sample. The argument assay can be provided to pass on the integer assay instead of the segment_ratios assay (adjust thresholds accordingly). Two geoms are available area or line. plotFreq(tumor) Group information can be set to any categorical element of the colData() and is provided with the argument group. plotFreq(tumor, group = &#39;subclones&#39;) 7.9 calcConsensus() Consensus sequences can help visualize the different segments across subclones. To calculate consensus matrices we can use calcConsensus(). tumor &lt;- calcConsensus(tumor) plotHeatmap() can plot a consensus heatmap: plotHeatmap(tumor, consensus = TRUE, label = &#39;subclones&#39;) ## order_cells argument is NULL. Samples are ordered according to ## colnames(CopyKit) ## Plotting Heatmap. plotHeatmap() can annotate the consensus heatmap with information from the metadata as long as label is the same as the information used to build the consensus matrix: plotHeatmap(tumor, consensus = TRUE, label = &#39;subclones&#39;, group = &#39;spatial_info&#39;) ## order_cells argument is NULL. Samples are ordered according to ## colnames(CopyKit) ## Plotting Heatmap. By default calcConsensus() uses the subclones information to calculate a consensus for each subclone. Any element of the colData() can be used to calculate the consensus. Note: Consensus matrices can be calculated from the integer assay. Importantly, the integer matrix must be in the assay(tumor, 'integer') slot. Check calcInteger() for more info. tumor &lt;- calcConsensus(tumor, consensus_by = &#39;subclones&#39;, assay = &#39;integer&#39;) 7.10 plotConsensusLine() To compare the differences among subclones, plotConsensusLine() opens an interactive app where the consensus sequences are plotted as lines. plotConsensusLine(tumor) Plot Consensus Line 7.11 plotGeneCopy() To check copy number states across of genes we can use plotGeneCopy(). Two different geoms: “swarm” (default) or “violin” can be applied. As with other plotting functions, points can be colored with the argument ‘label’. plotGeneCopy(tumor, genes = c(&quot;CDKN2A&quot;, &quot;FGFR1&quot;, &quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;PTEN&quot;, &quot;MYC&quot;, &quot;CDKN1A&quot;, &quot;MDM2&quot;, &quot;AURKA&quot;, &quot;PIK3CA&quot;, &quot;CCND1&quot;, &quot;KRAS&quot;), label = &#39;spatial_info&#39;) ## Coloring by: spatial_info A positional dodge can be added to facilitate the visualization across groups: plotGeneCopy(tumor, genes = c(&quot;CDKN2A&quot;, &quot;FGFR1&quot;, &quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;PTEN&quot;, &quot;MYC&quot;, &quot;CDKN1A&quot;, &quot;MDM2&quot;, &quot;AURKA&quot;, &quot;PIK3CA&quot;, &quot;CCND1&quot;, &quot;KRAS&quot;), label = &#39;subclones&#39;, dodge.width = 0.8) ## Coloring by: subclones A barplot geom is also provided to visualize the integer data as a frequency barplot for each gene: plotGeneCopy(tumor, genes = c(&quot;CDKN2A&quot;, &quot;FGFR1&quot;, &quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;PTEN&quot;, &quot;MYC&quot;, &quot;CDKN1A&quot;, &quot;MDM2&quot;, &quot;AURKA&quot;, &quot;PIK3CA&quot;, &quot;CCND1&quot;, &quot;KRAS&quot;), geom = &#39;barplot&#39;, assay = &#39;integer&#39;) 7.12 plotAlluvial() To visualize frequencies across elements of the metadata we can use plotAlluvial() plotAlluvial(tumor, label = c(&quot;subclones&quot;, &quot;spatial_info&quot;)) 7.13 runPca() Principal Component Analysis can be run with runPca() tumor &lt;- runPca(tumor) ## Using assay: logr ## Embedding data with PCA. ## Access reduced dimensions slot with: SingleCellExperiment::reducedDim(scCNA, &#39;pca&#39;). ## Done. The results are stored in the reducedDim(tumor, 'PCA') slot. Principal Components can be used as an alternative pre-processing step to the findClusters() function by changing findClusters() embedding argument to ‘PCA’. The number of principal components to be used for clustering can also be set within `findClusters() with the argument ncomponents. At this time better results are achieved by using the default UMAP embedding and it is the recommend pre-processing step. However PCA remains as a viable alternative 7.13.1 plotScree To determine the number of useful principal components a scree plot can be shown with: plotScree(tumor) 7.13.2 plotPCA To visualize the first 2 principal components you can use plotPca(). plotPca(tumor, label = &#39;spatial_info&#39;) ## Plotting PCA. ## Coloring by: spatial_info.

If you have a contribution and would like to add explanations for a method related to copy number data, please submit a PR. Contributions are extremely welcomed! 11.1 Copy Number data from short reads sequencing 11.2 Principle To infer copy number data from short-read sequencing we count the number of reads that align to a particular region of the genome. Counter intuitively, we are not drawn to the individual nucleotides, but the regions of the genome in which the reads have aligned. 11.3 VarBin To perform the alignment of millions of reads in a reasonable time frame, aligners trade-off accuracy for speed. Furthermore, the genome is filled with repetitive and hard to map regions. As a consequence, errors produced during the process of alignment are known as mapping errors. Mapping errors may be a significant source of bias. Correct estimation of copy number gains or losses is dependent on accurate control of different biases. To infer copy number variations and account for sources of bias, different methods have been developed, including the Variable Binning method. The VarBin method accounts for mapping bias by partitioning the genome into bins of variable sizes. The guiding principle is, if we were to map a diploid genome to our scaffold, each bin will receive an equal number of reads. To construct the VarBin scaffolds, reads are simulated from a reference genome and mapped back. The reference genome is partitioned into bins of variable sizes, that receive an equal amount of reads. We can construct scaffolds of different resolutions. Higher resolutions will have smaller bin sizes and detect more ‘focal’ copy number events. The decision of which resolution to use is dependent on diverse factors. Those include the library complexity, number of multiplexed cells, sequencer output, among others. Generally, a target of 1M reads/cell, with a 10% PCR duplicate rate, is sufficient to generate high-quality copy number profiles for the 220kb scaffold. 11.4 GC correction GC-content can be a source of bias within the counts. Normalization of GC content is performed as follows: Both fragment counts and GC counts are binned to a bin-size of choice. A curve describing the conditional mean fragment count per GC value is estimated. The resulting GC curve determines a predicted count for each bin based on the bin’s GC. These predictions can be used directly to normalize the original signal, or as the rates for a heterogeneous Poisson model. Extracted from: Summarizing and correcting the GC content bias in high-throughput sequencing. Benjamini &amp; Speed Therefore, we smooth the signal using loess normalization. 11.5 Merge Levels After segmentation, some segments remain with small differences, generating spurious breakpoints that are unlikely to be real copy number events. To remove this effect we perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the observed median across two segments. Segments that do not reach significance are merged. 11.6 How do we infer copy numbers We previously partitioned the reference genome into bins of variables size and performed the alignment of the reads to the bins, quantifying the number of reads contained in each bin. We can infer the relative copy number of a sample relative to the average number of reads of the sample. Therefore, we perform a sample-wise normalization of the bin counts by their mean. This way, a value of 1 corresponds to the average copy number of the sample, whereas higher values reflect amplified regions, and lower values represent genomic losses. The resulting matrix is known as the ratio matrix and it’s segmented counterpart is known as the segment ratios mean matrix. Importantly, with this normalization, we can’t immediately determine the integer copy number of a given segment. However several methods have been developed to infer the ploidy of a cell and its segments using short read sequencing. 11.7 Segmentation 11.7.1 CBS Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) is a popular method of segmentation. From the help of DNAcopy package (see ?DNAcopy::segment): This function implements the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm of Olshen and Venkatraman (2004). Given a set of genomic data, either continuous or binary, the algorithm recursively splits chromosomes into either two or three subsegments based on a maximum t-statistic. A reference distribution, used to decided whether or not to split, is estimated by permutation. Options are given to eliminate splits when the means of adjacent segments are not sufficiently far apart. Note that after the first split the α-levels of the tests for splitting are not unconditional.
