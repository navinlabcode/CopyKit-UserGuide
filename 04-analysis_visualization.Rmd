# Analysis and Visualization module

The analysis and visualization module from CopyKit work in synergy to help you analyze and assess the results from your day.

The analysis module provides the following functions: `runUmap()`, `calcInteger()`, `findSuggestedK()`, `findClusters()`, `calcConsensus()` and `runPhylo()`.

The visualization module functions are: `plotMetrics()`, `plotRatio()`, `plotUmap()`, `plotHeatmap()`, `plotConsensusLine()` and `plotGeneCopy()`.

## plotRatio()

It is often important to visualize that the segmentation behaved as expected and closely follows the ratios. Not missing important events. Ratio plots are a great tool for this. You can plot ratio plots with the `plotRatio()` function. `plotRatio()` has two different modes. When the input is the CopyKit object an interactive app will run and you can select which cell will be visualized.
```{r plot_ratio_app, eval = FALSE}
plotRatio(tumor)
```
<center>
![Ratio Plot App](images/plot_ratio_shiny.png)
</center>

If `plotRatio()` is given a sample name only the plot for that cell will be shown.
```{r plot_ratio_sample}
plotRatio(tumor, "TN28_2_S1_C10_S1930_L006_R1_001")
```


## runUmap()

runUmap uses generates a [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) reduced dimensions embedding, the resulting embedding is stored within the scCNA reducedDim slot and is an important pre-processing step to the findClusters feature.

```{r run_umap}
tumor <- runUmap(tumor)
```

Additional arguments to control umap parameters can be passed on to`runUmap()` with the '...' argument.

```{r}
tumor <- runUmap(tumor, n_neighbors = 30, min_dist = 0)
```

## plotUmap()

`plotUmap()` can be used to plot the reduced dimensional embedding. plotUmap can be colored by any element of the metadata with the argument 'label', this will be shown in a later section.

```{r}
plotUmap(tumor)
```

## Clustering

The `findClusters()` function will use the reduced dimensional embedding resulting from runUmap to perform clustering of superclones and subclones.

When clustering for superclones `findClusters()` creates a graph representation of the dataset reduced dimension embedding using a shared nearest neighbor algorithm (SNN), from this graph the connected components are extracted and generally represent high-level structures that share large, lineage defining copy number events.

CopyKit can also be used to detect subclones, i. e. groups of cells containing a unique copy number event per cluster, to do so the umap embedding is again used as the pre-processing step, this time to perform a density-based clustering with [hdbscan](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) as seen in the work from Laks *et al.* [@RN6].

### findSugestedK()

Density-based clustering requires input of the k neighbors, frequently chosen ad hoc. To help with parametrization, CopyKit provides the helper findSuggestedK function. findSuggestedK performs a clustering bootstrapping over a range of k values and returns the value that maximizes the jaccard similarity. While findSuggestedK does not guarantee that the suggested value will result in optimal clustering but provides a guide that maximizes cluster stability.

```{r find_suggested_k}
tumor <- findSuggestedK(tumor)
```

The suggested value is stored into the metadata and can be access at:
```{r find_sug_meta}
S4Vectors::metadata(tumor)$suggestedK
```

### findClusters()

To run `findClusters()` simply use the function in the CopyKit object and provide the k value with the arguments 'k_superclones' and 'k_subclones'.
*NOTE:* k_superclones and k_subclones can be used concurrently. Only k_subclones is a mandatory field.


```{r findCl_withparam}
tumor <- findClusters(tumor,
                      k_superclones = 30,
                      k_subclones = 15)
```

If `findSuggestedK()` was used and the argument 'k_subclones' is not provided, `findClusters()` will automatically use the value resulting from `findSuggestedK()` that was stored into the metadata:

```{r findCL_findSuggested}
tumor <- findClusters(tumor)
```

The results from the clustering can be visualized with different plotting functions. For example `plotUmap()` can be used with the argument 'label':

```{r plot_umap_subclones}
plotUmap(tumor, label = 'subclones')
```

## plotHeatmap()

A heatmap can be used to visualize the copy number profiles of the dataset annotated with the subclonal information:

```{r plot_heatmap_subclones, fig.height=8}
plotHeatmap(tumor, label = 'subclones')
```

Importantly, new information can be added to the metadata and used in conjuction with the plotting functions. The dataset in this example has some spatial information obtained from macrodissection of the tissue. It is encoded in the sample name by the letter S followed by a number. We can extract that information and add as an extra column to the metadata:

```{r add_spatial_info}
colData(tumor)$spatial_info <- str_extract(colData(tumor)$sample, "S[0-9]{1}")
```

Once the information has been added, we can use it to color the heatmap points by their spatial information:

```{r umap_spatial}
plotUmap(tumor, label = 'spatial_info')
```

It is also possible to annotate the heatmap with that information:
The 'label' argument for `plotHeatmap()` can add as many annotations as specified by the user as long as they are elements in `colData()` of the CopyKit object.
```{r heat_spatial, fig.height=8}
plotHeatmap(tumor, label = c("spatial_info", "subclones"))
```

## calcConsensus()

Consensus sequences can help visualize the different segments across the groups of cells. A consensus sequence can be calculated in CopyKit with the function `calcConsensus()`
```{r calc_consensus}
tumor <- calcConsensus(tumor)
```

`plotHeatmap()` can also plot consensus heatmap of the CopyKit object:
```{r plot_heat_consensus}
plotHeatmap(tumor, consensus = TRUE)
```

By default `calcConsensus()` uses the subclones information to calculate a consensus for each subclone. Importantly, any element of the `colData()` can be used to calculate the consensus.
```{r calc_consensus_spatial}
tumor <- calcConsensus(tumor, consensus_by = "spatial_info")
```

```{r consensus_spatial_head}
plotHeatmap(tumor, consensus = TRUE)
```

## plotConsensusLine()

To make it easier to compare the differences among the differences subclones, `plotConsensusLine()` opens an app where the consensus sequences are plotted as lines and a checkbox can be used to add overlays of the sequences. Making it easier to determine the differences between regions.

```{r calc_consensus_again, echo = FALSE}
tumor <- calcConsensus(tumor)
```

```{r plot_cons_line, eval=FALSE}
plotConsensusLine(tumor)
```

## calcInteger

Segment mean ratios can be scaled to integer values, this process of ploidy scaling is accomplished within CopyKit with `calcInteger()`. CopyKit supports using fixed value of ploidy that will scale all the cells (generally determined using Flow Cytometry). Alternatively, if different ploidies are needed for different cells, a vector containing the ploidies can be passed on to `calcInteger()` as long as it contains the same length and sample order as `colData()`

```{r calc_integer}
tumor <- calcInteger(tumor, ploidy_value = 3.45)
```

The integerized segment mean ratios are stored in the slot `integer` that can be accessed with the function `assay()`

If a value of ploidy exists, `plotRatio()` will use it to plot the integer copy number values as a secondary axis.
```{r plot_ratio_integer}
plotRatio(tumor, "TN28_2_S1_C10_S1930_L006_R1_001")
```

## plotGeneCopy

It might be of interest to check for the copy number states across all the samples for different genes. That can be done with `plotGeneCopy()` in two different geoms: “swarm” (default) or “violin”.
```{r}
tumor <- plotGeneCopy(tumor, genes = c("CDKN2A",
                                       "FGFR1",
                                       "TP53",
                                       "PTEN",
                                       "MYC",
                                       "EGFR",
                                       "ERBB2",
                                       "CDKN1A",
                                       "MDM2",
                                       "AURKA",
                                       "PIK3CA",
                                       "CCND1",
                                       "KRAS"))
```

It is also possible to visualize the integer data as a frequency barplot for each gene:
```{r plot_gene_copy_integer}
tumor <- plotGeneCopy(tumor, genes = c("CDKN2A",
                                       "FGFR1",
                                       "TP53",
                                       "PTEN",
                                       "MYC",
                                       "EGFR",
                                       "ERBB2",
                                       "CDKN1A",
                                       "MDM2",
                                       "AURKA",
                                       "PIK3CA",
                                       "CCND1",
                                       "KRAS"),
                      geom = "barplot",
                      assay = "integer")
```
