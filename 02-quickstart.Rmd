# Quick-Start

This section provides a basic *CopyKit* workflow. 

<!-- I always assume people need to have each step even loading the library. This is doubably true since you have different spellings/capitalizations.--> 
<!-- Yes. Sans paths, this page should work as copypasta for lazy people --> 

```{r quickstart, eval=FALSE}
# Load library
library(copykit)

# Run pre-processing module
# The output is an scCNA object
tumor <- runVarbin("/path/to/marked/bam/files/",
                 remove_Y = TRUE)

# Mark normal cells if they exist
tumor <- findNormalCells(tumor)

# Mark noisy cells for filtering
tumor <- filterCells(tumor)

# Visualize cells labeled by filter and normal status
plotHeatmap(tumor, label = c('filtered', 'is_normal'), row_split = 'filtered')

# Remove cells marked as noisy and/or normal from the copykit object
tumor <- tumor[,SummarizedExperiment::colData(tumor)$filtered == "kept"]
tumor <- tumor[,SummarizedExperiment::colData(tumor)$is_normal == FALSE]

# Create a umap embedding 
tumor <- runUmap(tumor)

# Search for the best K value for clustering of subclones 
# according to jaccard similarity and plot the results
tumor <- findSuggestedK(tumor)
plotSuggestedK(tumor)

# Find clusters of similar copy number profiles and plot the results
tumor  <- findClusters(tumor)
plotUmap(tumor, label = 'subclones')

# Calculate consensus profiles for each subclone, 
# and order cells by cluster for visualization with plotHeatmap
tumor <- calcConsensus(tumor)
tumor <- runConsensusPhylo(tumor)

# Plot a copy number heatmap with clustering annotation
plotHeatmap(tumor, label = 'subclones')
```

The following sections explain all functions in detail.
